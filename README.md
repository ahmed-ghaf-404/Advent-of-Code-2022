# Advent-of-Code-2022

## Adventurer Ahmed, Proceed!!
I'm attempting to finish the entire Advent of Code for this December! It's going to take place from the first of Decmeber until the 25th! 
<br>From what I remember, I'm gonna help Santa and his friends with their Christmas preperations with my (very) mighty programming skills! Since I'm not that busy now adays, and stressed out since finals are coming up, coding is what the doctor would have prescribed.

### Side Note:
I might have to speedrun one mid-December because I'll randomly be in Germany and then Oman. 
<br>**Therefore, I have to force myself to code Harder, Faster, Better, and Stronger! ***YES*** JUST LIKE THAT DAFT PUNK SONG! >:) >:)**
<br>I'm going to time myself to keep myself in check! It's an overall-good skill to be fast.

## [Day 1](01.py):
As the Elves and I were started the annual expedition, we realized that we need to know who has the most high calorie food among the Elves because they have to eat constantly.
<br>They first ask me to write a program to calculate all the calories in their indivisual food and tell them who had the most to refer to if anyone get hungry.
<br>I did it. It was an easy task, yet very helpful for the team! I just asked the computer to sum all the calories in their food and pick whoever is highest.
<br>They immediately realized that that was not enough. So they asked me to calculate the total of the top 3 highest calorie food bags. 
<br>I pulled up my laptop and started modifying the first answer. I created a list and added all the totals to it, sorted it, returned the top 3, and summed them.
<br>We were all releived to know we had enough food. Even some snacks for me!
### Fun facts:
- Santa-san doesn't allow Elves to eat during work hours, to minimize Elf-error injuries! 
- He does provide them with the best food after work, though! What a thoughtful man!
- Their food had a lot of tuna, I liked it! 
- I got 2 stars for Santa's reindeers from the expedition so far. I need 50!
